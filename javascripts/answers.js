your culture and climate by escaping the normal
campus routine and presenting your company from
the heart of your office.`,

event we are happy to facilitate this. By organ-
ising these events for you, we put you in direct
contact with selected students while we carry out
the managerial tasks of running the event.`,
  goodie: `To make your company heard by the students we can
help you by handing out gifts such as merchandise
or fruits with your logo outside a lecture hall
with students relevant for you. We could also
greet all students at a chosen location on campus
with a gift from you. The sky is the limit.`,
  marketing: `We provide a tailored marketing solution for
your company. We could write about your latest
project, internship opportunities or your upcoming
recruitment. The magazine that is created after
the project is distributed at KTH in 2000 copies
and gives another opportunity to reach students

beyond your event. You may advertise in the maga-
zine, through our social media channels; Facebook,

Instagram and LinkedIn, or our website.`,
